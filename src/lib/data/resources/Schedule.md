# Here Is How Our School Day Is Structured

What you’re about to see is an example of what a school day _can_ look like, not your exact schedule for next semester. This sample helps show the flow of our day—when we learn, move, eat, and play—but your child’s actual class schedule may look a little different.

We’ll go over your real schedule together before the semester begins, and teachers will help students learn it step by step.
