# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this still a homeschool co-op?

Yes. This is a parent-led homeschool co-op. Parents retain full responsibility for their child’s education and will still be responsible for:

- Filing intent to homeschool with their county or being under an umbrella school  
  *(Resources for this will be provided)*
- Reporting attendance and grades to their county

## What makes this different from other co-ops or hybrid programs?

- All students follow the same curriculum
- Families move at a shared pace
- There is more structure and support from the co-op
- Parents are not expected to choose a curriculum or create the schedule on their own

This model is designed to support parents while keeping education parent-led.

## Where will the co-op be located?

Mt. Lebanon Baptist Church

## Who will be teaching?

We have not started hiring yet, but we are seeking educators who:

- Share our vision, mission, and core values
- Have teaching experience
- Have strong classroom management skills
- Have experience with different learning styles and methods
- Have familiarity with educational resources beyond what most parents have at home

## What does a typical school day look like?

Our on-campus days are structured similarly to a traditional school day and include:

- Math
- Reading
- Language Arts
- Writing
- Science
- Recess

In addition, one day per week students will rotate through:

- Bible
- Art
- Music
- Gym
- Library

## How does curriculum work?

The director will choose the curriculum prior to the school year beginning. Teachers will then help set the pacing and structure so it is manageable and clear for families.

Curriculum has not been finalized, but we have trusted personnel who are looking into the best options for our families.

On school days, teachers lead instruction. On home days, parents lead instruction in a clear, sequential order.

## What will it cost?

Our goal is to keep tuition as close to **$3,000 per student** for the full school year as possible. Curriculum is not included in the tuition cost.

## What is the schedule?

- Two days per week on campus
- 8:30 AM–2:30 PM

## Are parents required to volunteer?

Each family is strongly encouraged to help with two events per year (class parties, school-wide events, fundraisers, etc.) to cultivate community and help take the load off administration.

## How do we apply?

We plan to start sharing more about this in the next few weeks.

## What does a yearly calendar look like?

Examples include:

- Monthly chapel
- Christmas program
- Thanksgiving feast
- Optional field trips
- Fall break
- Christmas break
- Spring break
