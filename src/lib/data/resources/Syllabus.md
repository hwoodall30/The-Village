# A Look Inside a Typical Class Week

## What to Expect: Workload, Rhythm & the Collaborative Partnership

This sample syllabus is designed to give families a clear picture of the structure, pace, and expectations of a typical week in our homeschool collaborative.

At the core of our model is the belief that parents are the primary teachers. Our role is to come alongside families by providing shared structure, instruction, accountability, and community support—not to replace the parent-led homeschool.

## How Learning Is Structured

Our homeschool collaborative operates from a shared syllabus and scope that families agree to follow when enrolling. Instruction happens across two connected environments—on-site collaborative days and at-home learning—working together toward the same goals.

### On-Site Collaborative Days

On collaborative days, students:

- Receive supplemental instruction aligned with the agreed-upon syllabus
- Participate in group learning, discussion, and hands-on activities
- Practice skills with teacher guidance and feedback
- Engage in community-based learning that benefits from shared space and peers

These days provide structure, clarity, and support for both students and parents. Teachers introduce, model, reinforce, and practice concepts that families are also teaching at home. On-site learning is not meant to replace parent instruction, but to support it through shared language, expectations, and accountability.

### At-Home Learning

At home, parents continue to function as the primary educators by:

- Teaching new concepts when appropriate
- Reinforcing or extending concepts introduced on-site
- Guiding practice, discussion, and application in a home setting
- Adjusting pacing and approach based on their child’s needs

At-home learning is an active teaching space where parents lead instruction with the confidence that they are supported by the collaborative’s teachers and structure. Families know that skills taught at home will be practiced, reinforced, and supported during on-site days.

## One Syllabus, Two Learning Environments

Our homeschool collaborative operates under one shared syllabus taught across two connected learning environments: on-site collaborative days and at-home learning. Both environments actively teach and reinforce the same goals, working together rather than one driving the other.

By enrolling, families commit to following a shared scope, sequence, and general weekly pace, participating in on-site instruction, and completing aligned at-home learning.

Within that structure, families retain flexibility to adjust pacing, spend extra time where needed, move more quickly when appropriate, and organize at-home learning in a way that fits their family rhythm. Concepts may be introduced in either setting and strengthened in the other, with ongoing communication between parents and teachers.

For most families, at-home learning can be completed in short, focused blocks of time. Younger students will require more parent involvement, while older students will gradually build independence.

This collaborative is not a traditional school-at-home model. It exists to support parents as the primary educators by providing structure, accountability, and community. We value mastery, consistency, and joy in learning and walk alongside families as they lead their child’s education.
