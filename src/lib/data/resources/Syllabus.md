# Here is a Look Into a Class Syllabus

## What to Expect: Weekly Workload & Rhythm

This sample syllabus is meant to give families a clear picture of the pace, structure, and expectations of a typical week in our homeschool collaborative.

Work is intentionally divided between:

- **On-site learning** during our collaborative days, where students receive instruction, participate in group learning, and practice skills with guidance
- **At-home learning**, which reinforces concepts already taught and allows families to work at a rhythm that fits their home

For most families, at-home work can be completed in short, focused blocks of time and is designed to feel manageable—not overwhelming. Younger students will require more parent involvement, while older students will gradually build independence.

This syllabus is an example, not a rigid checklist. Families are encouraged to:

- Adjust pacing as needed
- Spend extra time where a child needs support
- Move efficiently through daily tasks

Our goal is to support parents, not replace them, and to create a learning environment that values mastery, consistency, and joy in learning over busyness. You do not need to recreate a traditional school-at-home experience—this collaborative is designed to walk alongside you as you grow in confidence as a homeschooling parent.
